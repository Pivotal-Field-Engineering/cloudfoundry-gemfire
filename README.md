<h1> VMware has ended active development of this project, this repository will no longer be updated.</h1><br># Cloudfoundry-gemfire

Prior to utilizing this demo Application it is assumed you have:

* Created a CloudFoundry environment.  For example, using this [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite)
* Deployed Gemfire and the Gemfire Service Broker using BOSH.  See this: [https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/gemfire-bosh-release](https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/gemfire-bosh-release)
* Running the sample app assumes there is a region created called 'test'.  This may be created using GFSH and service broker functions installed along with the Gemfire Service broker:
```
gfsh> execute function --id=provision --arguments=test
 ```
 
#### Build your application using maven
 ```

#### You should now be able to put and get from a cache defined in the app using a browser or command line app:
```
C02JW12SDKQ5-3:cf-gemfire azwickey$ curl http://gemfire-cloud.10.244.0.34.xip.io/put/some-awesome-value/HelloGemfire

C02JW12SDKQ5-3:cf-gemfire azwickey$ curl http://gemfire-cloud.10.244.0.34.xip.io/get/some-awesome-value
